The project uses econometric tools to study housing prices in the US. In particular, we will try to predict the housing prices for the state of California using time series analysis. 

The dataset used is the [Zillow's aggregated housing market and economic data](https://zillow.com/data) which is collected by the Zillow's Economic Research Team from a variety of public and proprietary sources.
